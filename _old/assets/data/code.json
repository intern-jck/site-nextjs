I started by writing some Python to perform Google searches for makerspaces in each state.  I took all the data which was returned and filtered through each entry to test for valid urls and format things like names.  I wasn't clever enough to create an algorithm to do this for me and since the data set was only a few hundred rows, I made some coffee and brtue forced my way through.  I created an svg image of all the US states and added event handlers to allow the user to see the list of makerspaces by clicking on a state.  This was a very fun project and I plan to add more data soon!",
