    "info": "I stumbled across an open source package called Crankshaft which can link an Android and Raspberry Pi together to allow you setup your own navigation system.  I 3D printer a housing and replaced the radio console (which was dead at this point) in hopes of making my own.  Wiring was a pain and I messed up a few details like screen orientation, but learned a lot!  While it was cool while I had it, I ended up taking out due to not being able to createa safe shutdown for the Pi and the fact a slight bump in the road would disconnet the power harness, resetting the whole thing.  Oh well.  Still learnt a lot!",

I have a hard time finding anyone who has heard of them but I had a 30 watt tube studio amp and loved it.  The tone was great with a nice healthy gain.  However, my cat completely tore up the fabric coating the amp and then the speaker cracked.  I made a new head cabinet for the tube amp and laser cut a panel with some artist liberties.  Finally, some wood staind and glue to put the whole thing together.  Now I can keep that sound I loved alive!",

The speakers were great and similar to what is used in Orange cabinets, which happen to be a favorite of mine.  I wanted to do the amps justice and build a proper cab.  Using layers of 3/4 inch thick mdf, wood glue and inspiration from Orange cab dimensions, I built one heavy duty cabinet.  The speakers sound amazing, especially through my Red Bear head.  Who cares if it's too heavy to move?",
