The machine included a functional dumb waiter to move coats between floors as well as numerous mechanical elements such as a sequence of automated bobble heads, Newton's Cradle and a coat hanger which moved a coat around the structure on a custom designed track.  An Arduino Mega was used to control the many motors and sensors throughout the structure.  A script written in the Arduino IDE controlled each of the elements through a timed sequence of events.  Each of the elements movements were written in a non-blocking fashion to allow for multiple actions to take place at the same time such as sensor readings and motor position changes.  A large red button was used as the start button for the events.  Certain elements required parts which could not be bought.  These were modeled in Fusion 360 and 3D printed using a Flashforge Creator Pro.  The dumb waiter acted independently from the ascetic elements which were triggered when a large red button at the base of the structure was pressed.",

The Nano runs a script written to receive and send data to the Pi as well as control the motors, sensor input and various lighting elements.  CAD models of the dispenser and parts were designed using Fusion 360 which allowed for parts to be imported directly from McMaster-Carr.  When designs were finalized, parts were 3D printed, ordered from McMaster- Carr or built at my workshop.  Once assembled, testing took place over the course of many days to ensure all mechanism were flawless before both dispensers were shipped to a fabrication shop who would incorporate my design into the final build.",

The Pi ran a Processing IDE sketch to control game state changes, color patterns for the multiple sections of LED strips, and handle sensor input from the Arduino Uno using the Firmata protocol.  A Python sketch controlled all audio playback, printing of prize tickets, and emailing staff to alert them when the grand prizes were won.

Each of the 4 Raspberry Pis connect to a single Raspberry Pi using ethernet cables and a desktop switch.  This single Pi awaits user input from the staff to start and stop the game.  The Pis communicate using Open Sound Control.  On each Pi, a Processing IDE sketch is used to control each stall's Pi and the main Pi controlling the game state changes.  The Processing sketch handles audio playback, reading of incoming state changes, scoreboard updating and communication with the Arduino Nano via the Firmata protocol.
